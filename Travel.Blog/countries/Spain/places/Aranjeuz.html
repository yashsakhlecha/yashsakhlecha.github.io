        	<div class="biog"> </br></br> Aranjeuz, is another day trip that can be made from Madrid for free. It is a small town and has a couple of student universities. </br></br>Aranjeuz has a 'Plaza de Torres', which translates to Bull center. This is one of the few places in Central/ Northern Spain where Bull fights yet take place and it also has a museum showcasing the history of Bull fighting in Spain. This unfortunately was shut when we were visitng the place and hence couldn't enter it. Apart from this, there does't seem to be much to do here, however, due to less crowd and hardly any tourists, it is very peaceful and quite. 
        	</br></br> Aranjeuz has a beautiful and well maintained park and taking a stroll around there is a must. You might bump into a few locals there and if at all they know English, they will right away grab this opportunity to practise it with you. </br></br>Although uneventful, there was something about this town that I might not be able to pinpoint which made me happy that day and I left the town satisfied.
